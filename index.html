        <p>Dear Reader, <br><br> Here are my concerns:<br><br> That if I ask you to forget, the first thing you will do is remember. The first thing will call up the second, the third and the fourth and a timeline will be established.<br><br> Linearities
            sneak up on you; they organise, order and arrange without you noticing ; allowing things to be easy to follow, making you expect simplicity. They frustrate me and I will try to avoid them.<br><br> I am looking for ways to express my thoughts
            like a walk, I am looking for ways to tell a story about time, where the I stands for the personal pronoun used by a speaker to refer to himself or herself but it is not limited to the 9th letter of the latin alphabet, the subject or the object
            of self-consciousness ; the ego, a line, the electric current or iodine. From perspectives that don’t assume humanity and avoid anthropomorphising. <br><br> Think of baroque polyphonic choirs, think of entanglements.<br><br> My voice being
            one of them, not the principal. As the author of this text, this is the only time I will exercise my authority over you, to offer you the following reminder. Partially because I am concerned with how much of a good job I have done and partially
            because I don’t know how accountable you will hold me. I would advise for very, and urge you to look closely through each line, for when I fail to do as I preach. <br><br> Now saying this, here is where we stand. You should forget and proceed
            to read with no assumptions and prior knowledge of how things are ought to be or you should keep on remembering that you know and you assume.<br><br> Welcoming remarks,<br> Victoria

            <p>Since its establishment as a scientific concept by Newton, time has gained its objectiveness through being uniform, infinite, continuous and effortlessly divisible<span class="footnote">1</span>. Time gains some of its other characteristics
                from Christianity, its foundation in the now is predominately influenced by the Christian vision of the world where earthly time and eternity, are separated, since ‘eternity cannot be measured in segments of time, it is an attribute of
                God’<span class="footnote">2</span> disconnecting time from past and future.</p> <br>
            <p>The mechanised clock itself was built in order to gain preciseness in praying.</p>

        <article class="quote">
            <p>In 1339 Heinrich Suso wrote a manuscript about a clock (“Horologium Sapentiae / Wisdom’s Watch upon the Hour”) that serves as a means of communication between man and the divine order. The clock translates the divine order into language that
                the ordinary man can understand. Particularly when it is time to pray<span class="footnote">3</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="time">
            <p>The same quest for accuracy and preciseness that created the clock for punctual praying. Has moved us from the imprecise mechanical clock to the extremely precise, atomic clock, recently building one that will probably outlast our Sun. Having
                spend the last 680 years building the most precise clock possible, to capture time, we have advanced from approximate errors of 15 min per day to 1 second per 10 billion years<span class="footnote">4</span>.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Time seems to exist independently of us, it is universal; an hour is an hour, is sixty minutes, three thousand six hundred seconds indifferently to whether it was spend productively or dreadfully<span class="footnote">5</span>. You would imagine
                that as our time is astrological and literally reflects the rotation of the Earth that it would be grounded in our understanding in such way but, it isn’t, time seems to exists anywhere else but here.</p> <br>

            <p>Contemporary man is more than capable of dealing with time recklessly at ease. We seem to have mastered time, created it, figured out how to measure, divided it with great precision, and trace it back million of years to its creation and yet
                somehow we seem to lack the understanding of its temporality or how is can be perceived differently.

            <h1>side thought</h1>
            <p>June 30th 2012 was the third ‘leap second’ incident after almost a decade of not having any. As the Earth’s rotation around itself actually takes 24 hours and 2 seconds instead of just 24, every now and then the International Telecommunications
                Union (UTI) has to add a second to even things out <span class="footnote">6</span>.</p><br>
            <p> This is necessary due to the existence of two times: Greenwich Mean Time, which alines noon with the time when the sun is at it’s highest position in Greenwich, London and was the time all official clocks followed until the of fall 1967. And
                Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which was adapted by several countries after 1976, and is calculated as 1 second of mean solar time at 0° longitude <span class="footnote">7</span>. </p><br>
            <p> Due to the fact that the later clock takes into account the Earth’s rotation a difference is created between the two clocks: less than a second in a year, up to 30 seconds since the implementation of UTC turns into minutes and hours as the
                year and millennia go by <span class="footnote">8</span>.</p><br>
            <p> It was that leap second 23:59:60 that caused Reddit to be in different states of off for about 2 hours. Reddit, the popular discussion website runs on the operating system Linux. Originally the glitch that drove the servers into hyperactivity
                was attributed to something else, but after a while the true cause was found. In one of the most basic levels of the operating system a linux kernel, the hrtimer, could not understand what the extra second was.<span class="footnote">9</span>.</p>

            <article class="quote">
                <p>hrtimer is a subsystem that used when an application is “sleeping,” waiting for the OS to complete some other task. In some cases, it sets a kind of alarm clock for these sleeping applications that will go off when the OS is taking too
                    much time with its other work.”<span class="footnote">10</span></p>
            </article>

            <p>What seems to have happened is that when the leap second arrived, the hrtimer became a second ahead of the OS, started awaking several sleeping applications, running the system into hyperactivity. The solution came by eventually restarting
                the servers<span class="footnote">11</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The problem with leap seconds is that programmers built the core kernels which have to deal with them in the 1970s, when leap seconds weren’t a thing yet. They were built with the expectation that time always moves forward, time cannot go
                backwards and time cannot repeat itself : all principles that the leap second renounces.<span class="footnote">12</span>
            </p><br>
            <p>Mozzilla, The Gawker, Stumble Upon, Yelp, Foursquare and Linkedln, all also carried confused hrtimer kernels that caused similar problems<span class="footnote">12</span>. Google hoping to avoid major problems has created an antidote called
                the “leap smear”. It operates by modifying Google’s NTP servers, specifically the Network Time Protocol which </p>
            <article class="quote">
                <p>periodically checks the computers’ time against a more accurate server, which may be connected to an external source of time, such as an atomic clock<span class="footnote">13</span></p>
            </article>
            <p>and adds occasionally a couple milliseconds making so that when the leap second finally arrives Google’s clock will have already accounted for it<span class="footnote">14</span>. It is a 20 hour linear smear, 72,000 SI seconds that eventually
                add up to the required leap<span class="footnote">15</span>.
            </p><br>
            <p>In a sense the leap smear slows down the hrtimer to meet with with the Earth’s rotation. Making Google’s servers, clocks and computers for 20 hours at a time completely in tune with the landscape they exist upon more than the humans who programmed
                them.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="time">

            <p>If it wasn’t for software we would have very little or any at all interaction with leap seconds, or by extend the rotation of the Earth for that matter. Our electronic devises and clocks update automatically. Even if they didn’t, nobody would
                be able to notice that they are running a second ahead. This is mostly due to the fact that humans inhabit social time instead of astrological time<span class="footnote">16</span>.</p>

            <p>Social time is manifested in expressions like ‘let’s meet during lunch’ or ‘i haven’t seen him since highschool’ or ‘right after the Obama administration’ all indicating points of time in respect to social events rather than astrological time.
                Lone astrological time references like 30/06/2012 or 1982 or March 2nd become significant only when they are put within social references<span class="footnote">18</span>.

            <p>Big general concepts that effect everyone, become staples of social time in urban settings such as work hours, weekends or holidays. Smaller events like natural phenomena, birthdays or which fruits are in season fail to reach the common social
                time system.
            </p><br>
            <p>Social time is not ‘uniform and homogenous’ like astrological time. It is heterogenous, allowing several different systems and kinds of time to exist parallel and interwoven to each other. Greek immigrants talking to each other on the train
                can remark upon not seeing their families since Clean Monday (27/2/2017) while looking forward to seeing them again at Koningsdag,(27/04/2017) and understand each other as they are part of two social time understandings.
            </p><br>
            <p>23:59:60 as a SI second falls under astronomical time but as ‘leap second’ as an event it enters the social time sphere, creating a moment of common reference in our western social time not centred around humans, that is as rare as a leap
                second.
            </p><br>
            <p>Our perception of time — social and astrological — solemnly follows the rhythms of human social life. 9 at work is 9 at work, irrelevant to whether it is dark or light, or papayas are in season.

        <article class="quote">
            <p>Progress is embedded too, in widely accepted assumptions about what it means to be human. […] we learn over and over again that human are different from the rest of the living world because we look forward - while other species, which live
                day by day, are thus dependent on us<span class="footnote">21</span></p>

            <p>Their social time follows mutually the cycles of human and non-human environments. Weekends are not social time staples because during the rounding season or the earmarking, rest days, if any, are uncertain.

            </p><br>
            <p> Preciseness or punctuality is traded in for variability, proximity and temporality. Mazzullo and Inglod observe that to represent a few moments, Sámi would use an expression meaning ‘the lighting of a pipe’ (pii’po-tsâhk ’ke ’tâm-pod’dâ) and
                a longer period would be ‘the time needed to brew coffee’ (käf ’ fevuos’ sâm-pod’dâ) and depending to where those expressions were used, it would range from a few minutes (village) to a period of few hours (forest)<span class="footnote">22</span></p>.
            <br>
            <p> Time is interwoven into activities, it is culturally understood that tasks or travelling might take longer than anticipated. When a Sámi travels through the boreal forest, he or she can provide only vague indications on how much time it will
                take to arrive and to return, the vastness of the forest region is such that a traveller cannot anticipate if something will occur or when<span class="footnote">23</span></p>.

            <br>
            <p> Duration is another notion, that is treated differently within the Sámi understanding of time preciseness is so embedded in the western thought of time, that tasks and activities tend to demand a finite start and end unlike the reindeer herding,
                which as a nature of work cannot be dictated by a clock marking the start and the end.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>[W]hen Sámi people go to the forest from reindeer separation or earmarking of calves, no-one would ever look at their watches. [..] In winter, the reindeer separation would be started in pitch darkness and it would still be dark when the work

        <article class="time">
            <p>It would be easy here to argue that the Sámi understanding of time is circular and it evokes a sense of local infinity that western understanding doesn’t, to create images of Sámi living without clocks and beyond time, fundamentally opposing
                the West. To follow an argument like that would play right into the hands of the dualistic discourse in which time has always been discussed in.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>[T]he logic of that argument being that there exists a clear-cut and structured division between western and non-western understanding of the world, running from the very categorical distinction between modern and traditional societies, to
                the more subtle difference between a supposedly western understanding of time as linear, cumulative and irreversible and the non-western notion of time as cyclical, non-cumulative and reversible<span class="footnote">25</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="time">
            <p>yet the world doesn’t work like this, even though the West likes to write about it in that way.</p><br>
            <p>The Sámi have spent years in contact or as part of the western world. Suffered from marginalisation and forced assimilation, years of timely issued taxes and fines to be payed in order to be allowed to live in their land. Legislation that
                did not allow them to speak their language or practise their religion. Nowadays Sámi have jobs outside reindeer herding, they serve as teachers or doctors or lawyers. They have jobs that require them to follow at 9 to 5 schedule.
            </p><br>
            <p>The Sámi are very much aware of western time systems, and their unwillingness to follow them is not be romanticised as a “truer” or “simpler”. It functions within the heterogeneous social time.

            </p><br>
            <p>The Sámi perception of time, much like Sámi culture, is founded in the landscape they inhabit. Time does not appear as a mystical powerful force that determines everything. As seen in Valkeapää words ‘time does not exist ’, not because time
                is elsewhere or time is elusive, but because time is ‘located’. The centre lyric of the poem with the single word ‘land’ carries much of the weight of time and location: time is experienced like the landscape, it is as familiar as the
                forest, the present as a form of duration blends in with the past and the future and it is representation in the flora and the fauna of the boreal forest, the past never ceases to exist as it is found in the repetition of activities conducted
                in the forest and the forest itself. Time is located ‘here’.
            </p><br>

            <p>When time is located here, it involves ‘living day by day’ and being entangled with concepts of indeterminacy and precarity. One is open to the possibilities of encounters, that encourage adapting and transforming. That result in actions or
                occupations have an undetermined beginning and end, and still are, like going to work everyday, repetitive.

            <p> Sámi traditional knowledge in terms of snow and reindeer herding reflects practicing such living :</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>So when somebody says that there is cuoŋu (“strong- crusted snow”) now, then the other person immediately knows that the snow is now so hard that it provides an excellent surface to move and travel on, but at the same time he or she also knows
                that in such conditions the reindeer move quickly over great distances, which, in turn means that the herd must be tightly managed to avoid it running off or breaking up and scattering. These terms contain references to the interaction
                between reindeer, man and land.<span class="footnote">28</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="time">
            <p>The myriad of Sámi terms like cuoŋu, (See Sámi Snow Terminology) used to describe precise snow characteristic are crucial in respect to grazing, mobility and tracking. Identifying quickly such factors is important as snow conditions directly
                affect the survival and well being of the reindeer. The traditional Sámi snow terms identify snow characteristics in regard of food access, mobility, tracking, visibility, season and snow layers<span class="footnote">29</span>.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>“Čearga can be so hard that neither reindeer nor people can dig through the snow. In areas with čearga, reindeer are “locked out” from grazing on the plants beneath the snow. This causes poor feeding conditions for the reindeer. The thickness
                of a čearga layer can be from 5 cm to one meter deep. Čearga conditions affect the mobility of both reindeer and humans as it is easy to travel on this type of snow. Consequently the herders have to be very careful not to lose individual
                reindeer to neighbouring herds. However, in terms of tracking capabilities, čearga is unfavorable. It is difficult to see where individual reindeer have been walking. Čearga is at the top of the snowpack, but may include as much as half
                the snowpack when grazing conditions are poor. The term čearga is used in winter, from January to April.” <span class="footnote">30</span>

            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="time">
            <p>As captured by the snow terminology, within Sámi culture, preciseness is attributed in terms of spatial characteristics (weather, snow, conditions, herd location etc) and not in terms of time (09/07/2017 or 6 o’clock)<span class="footnote">31</span>.
                Making it so that if there is čearga perhaps a trip will be postponed until it passes or a herder will choose to keep moving in search of another terrain instead of resting.
            </p><br>
            <p>In the few studies conducted about the Sámi understanding of time (see Ingold & Mazzulo, Mazzulo, Bergaman), the Sámi are credited with their own perception of time, phrased in a spectrum of different levels of romanticisation. All researches
                seem to agree if you are not talking about time the same way as the West is, you must then have a different perception of time. That type of thinking paints of a picture of social time as uniform and homogenous while perhaps unwilling
                propagates exclusion and marginalisation of minority groups and indigenous peoples. </p><br>
            <p>The Sámi perception of time does not differ from the western perception of time, what creates a difference between the two, is the point of references of each social time. The fact that non-humans and spatial characteristics hold the same
                importance as human centric events within Sámi time, makes it so that it would be impossible to impose ‘preciseness’ as it is understood in the western world, ‘marked by exactness and accuracy of expression or detail’.
            </p><br>
            <p>It seems hard to grasp, that if time is not precisely quantitive, can be of any good use. Yet it is not time that generates preciseness but the clock and especially, the tyranny it extorts through its connection to social and political control<span
                    class="footnote">32</span>. You have to be at work everyday at 9 in order to assist the forward march of progress, and that is only possible if it is precise and accurately measurable. Sámi time is a qualitative local system, that does
                not need to be scalable or homogenous. Sámi time should be explored as a part of the multidimensional social time, and not as existing outside of it.
            </p><br>
            <p>Social time, since its introduction as a concept, has mainly been explored in terms of duration, direction, form and shape. Sorokin and Merton point out that :
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>“Most social scientists have proceeded on the tacit assumption that no system of time other than those of astronomy or imperfectly related calendar is possible or, if possible, useful. They have assumed a time, the parts of which are comparable,
                which is quantitive and possessed of no qualitative aspects, which is continuous and permits of no lacunae. […] [I]n the field of social dynamics such restriction to a single conception of time involves several fundamental shortcomings”

            <p>Attributing a different perception of time to the Sámi, because their signifiers and attitude towards time are different is such a shortcoming. Social time as a concept is wide enough to include local systems, temporal patterns, non-human

            <p>This work has looked a lot into polyphonies as a methodology of overlaying several different voices in telling one song or more accurately in this case one story.

        <p>since that early mention of polyphonies, I have been captivated by their possible of being used as a methodology as not just as a metaphor for complex systems.</p> <br>
          <p>Polyphonies as opposed to monophonies, consists of two or more simultaneous indented melodies, where it is hard to trace which melody is the dominant of the the principal one. Musically polyphonies were used a lot in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as a musical texture.</p>

          <p>Allowing the songs to be layered with multiple storylines that are not bound to linearity. </p> <br>
          <p>
            Usually when one traces the history of polyphonies, one would stop with polyphonic signing  neglecting to get into account hip hop that often follows the practice of polyphonic arrangements. Kanye West as a producer is often credited as the best in layering multiple voices, at time even voices and are not entirely human. It seems important to point the distinction between, West as a rapper and West and a producer. As a rapper he is one of the voices in the composition, equal with everyone and everything else in the song. As a producer he takes a step back, which allows him to view the song as a whole and compose.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
          What polyphonies can produce so beautifully and Kanye West does so masterfully is to capture something intriguingly.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
          <p><u>Ultralight Beam</u>, widely talked about as perhaps Kanye’s best song, is a combination of everything West had explored until that point. It involves a choir, one that West has assembled himself this time.”<span class="footnote">5</span> </p>
        </article>
        <article class="long_thoughts">
          <p>What West gains from assembling his own choir is character and drama, in places beyond where we are used to look for character and drama; the principal character or voice.  The choir does not serve as a filler in the background. It shifts the vocal landscape giving you the impression that once they are close to you and the next moment away, situating the voices in space. <u>Ultralight Beam </u> follows voices through their stories. Rather than limiting our attention to one voice or the relationship of two it forces the listeners to focus on the assemblage, on the gathering of voices.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>“Kanye layers voices and he doesn’t limit them to singing or rapping, they become the base, the percussion or anything required in the song.”

        <article class="long_thoughts">
            <p>It moves on by rejecting principality, you would expect that when the song reaches its peak moment, West as the artist’s who the song is credited to and owner of album in which it will be included, would take the lead and rap, yet he doesn’t,
                instead he gives the space to Chance the Rapper. West also avoids to sign off the song, the epilogue is provided by Kirk Franklin, with the very last lyric sang by the choir. Within the 05:20 minutes of the track, West covers only 01:24
                of the whole song.

            <p>What I see here besides interesting producing, is a methodology to write about the world as complex system. A series of tools that would allow us to explore systems and share their stories, from a multi - perspective inclusive of humans, non-humans,
                technological systems, ideas and so one and so forth. I am not interested in transporting the entire body go musical theory and composition into the roam of writing, I am interested in the possibility of using polyphonies to construct
                dynamic stories.
            </p><br>
            <p>Of course, I am not the first one to ever think so. Fiction writers have been utilising polyphonies to structure narratives for years. Miklail Bakhtn introduced the concept of the polyphonic novel back in 1934, as a reading of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s
                work.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>“polyphony is a feature of narrative, which includes a diversity of points of views and voices”
                <span class="footnote">7</span> </p>
        </article>
        <article class="long_thoughts">
            <p>The method have been utilised in several different ways by several different authors, J.M Coetzee, Milan Kundera, Paul Williams, Etgar Keret, are just some of them. Recently Belarusian author Sventlana Alexievich was awarded the Nobel Price
                in literature “for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time”
            </p><br>
            <p>What is common within the work of these writers is their tendency to “allusive” and “repetitive”, choosing to expand forms and notions over a more “direct” or “logical” or “economical” presentation.
            </p><br>
            <p>It seems almost comical to me how we expect narratives to be “economical”, how the scientific idiom, or perhaps its aura — not completely sure how much economics qualifies as science — has leaked in all aspects of human life, including fiction
                writing. The understanding of “economical” as ‘using no more than necessary’, reflects the scientific goal of always seeking the simplest solution, Occam’s razor<span class="footnote">8</span>. Newton, who has earlier mentioned for establishing
                astronomical time, pretty much established Occam’s razor, as a scientific principal in his work
                <u>Pricilla Mathematica</u> and polluted all kinds thinking with this logic.</p><br>
  <p>This quest for simple and elegant solutions, assumes that there is a direct connection between simplicity and truth<span class="footnote">9</span>. What it mainly does through the elimination of complexity and excess is to remove site specific content. And make things widely scalable and applicable to all. To expect fictional stories to be shaped in such way, seems almost unbelievable to me</p><br>
  <p>What seems necessary is to find a way to dismantle the scientific idiom in a manner that would allow complexity and lack-of-scalability to exist and to be considered valuable<span class="footnote">10</span>.
</p><br>
<p>Eira’s wonderful doctoral thesis,<u> The Silent Language of Snow : Sámi traditional knowledge of snow in the times of climate change</u> does so by being written in both Sámi and English. In that way advancing Sámi as a language in which science is conducted. An important step for indigenous peoples and minorities towards moving into the scientific arena and meeting science
                in their own terms<span class="footnote">11</span>. Further Eira demonstrates how Sámi traditional snow terminology includes advances and complex snow science terms, in a way defining Occam’s razor. And how it is important for the national
                adaptive strategies for climate change to incorporate different ways of knowing, including both traditional knowledge and scientific knowledge<span class="footnote">12</span>.
            </p><br>
            <p>Tsing observes how science and scientific studies are conducted so differently in East and West, that western scientists avoid Japanese studies even though they are the leading experts in field matsuke mushrooms by offering the following instance
                :</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>“when criticising[,] American scientists comment about Japanese studies […] ‘are too descriptive’. Descriptive means site-specific, that is, attuned to indeterminate encounters and thus non-scalable”
                <span class="footnote">13</span> </p>
        </article>
        <article class="long_thoughts">
            <p>I feel in a way, polyphonic writing is an antidote to Occam’s razor and the monophony of the scientific idiom. It creates the form for busy and complex answers, that require the reader to disassemble them. Occam’s razor and other “economical”
                solutions assist simplicity and straightforwardness to an extent that I at times find frustrating. That type of writing praises simple and scalable explanations, forbids tangents from the subject or explorations of something that is partially
                fitting, but not aiding the progress the story forward.
            </p><br>
            <p>This work has tried to follow all this tools — failed or succeeded at times — by implementing the idea of polyphonic composing to writing. By including quotes as raw samples, crediting the sources of thoughts directly and not paraphrasing
                them. Citing references even when a text or an author has provided inspiration for form or format and not content.
            </p><br>
            <p>By trying to disrupt the traditional structure of an argumentative essay, creating way to unpack notions and ideas, that are usually treated in segments. Allocating time to build me own “choir”, inclusive of humans, non-humans, landscapes,
                technological comportants, poetry and music. To build a complex story of complicated and elaborated characters.
            </p><br>
            <p>To tell a story of three times, that of the landscape, of Sámi time and of the West, as if one could see them unfold as one walks by. Focusing on patterns and systems that don’t always follow the desired simplicity and predictability of the
                west. In this slow matter of developing it has worked through time scales that are unwitnessed by humans, from the pattern of forest developments to SI seconds. Offering a peek into otherness.
            </p><br>
            <p>This work aims to create an understanding of the heterogeneity of time. And how time like everything else can be understood from several different perspectives. To serve as a remedy for the type of thinking that demands simplification in order
                to understand.
            </p><br>
            <p>This walk starts in media-res,
                <u> so let’s say, you walk down a path and you run into a snag, a dead tree, a unexpected drawback — a soarvi</u>, begins with us already in conversation, yet it doesn’t matter what we were discussing before diving in, before running into the soarvi, the big or peculiar standing dead tree, that will remain a point of references in our walk. As we
                try to find our way around or through the fact that you know. The fact that your knowledge, knowledges all your future knowledge<span class="footnote">14</span>.
            </p><br>
            <p>Our soarvi, standing in the middle of our walk, between the foreground, the end, the picture and the background. </p><br>
            <p>Always starting at the middle and finishing before you start, provides the opportunity for you to be aware of form and just content. To understand perhaps how things are before knowing what they are. And for me, to invite you to practice the
                art of noticing, a form of awareness and sensitivity towards details, and I explore in all the bodies of my work.</p><br>
            <p>To interrupt you with interludes and side thoughts to reenforce that linearities and easy to follow sequences should not be expected. To learn all things from the beginning, out of an alphabet book, letter by letter, concept by concept, thought
                by thought.</p><br>
            <p>To zoom out and to understand that science sometimes paints a bigger picture leaving out all the participating characters and drama, and that if you look closely, humans might not even come into the picture till the very end.
            </p><br>
            <p>To be aware of an elaborate background that is busy and active and not there to server as a backdrop to a single hero’s triumph journey.
            </p><br>
            <p>To understand the language and if not to be aware that you don’t</p><br>
            <p>To realise the context and the interest that motivated telling this story comes from personal and subjective experiences. </p><br>
            <p>To be alert how site-specific this story is, and at the same time that is spanned over three different communities of Sámi, all distinctive from each other, trying not to summarise them all under an all-inclusive term.
            </p><br>
            <p>To draw a circle large enough, where “idiom” could be ‘a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words’ and ‘the dialect of a people or part of a country’ and ‘a characteristic mode
                of expression in music or art’.

<h1>Sámi traditional snow terminology</h1>
<p><h2>Vahca</h2>s new snow. Vahca causes bad travel conditions, but makes it easy to see where the reindeer have gone (track). Vahca can soften hard snow. The reindeer feel free to walk in different directions under such conditions.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Vahca</h2>is new snow. Vahca causes bad travel conditions, but makes it easy to see where the reindeer have gone (track). Vahca can soften hard snow. The reindeer feel free to walk in different directions under such conditions.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Čearga</h2>is created by strong winds which have blown the snow and rolled it to become hard. Čearga is so hard that neither reindeer nor herders can dig through it. Where čearga occurs, grazing is prevented and reindeer are “locked out” of the pasture. Čearga can have a thickness of one meter.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Seaŋáš</h2>occurs in the winter, when it has been cold for a while, then the seaŋáš process (seaŋkut) starts. Refrigeration promotes this process. In spring, the wind can change the snow to seaŋáš. The snow is grainier and is not stuck to the ground. It is easy to move it and the reindeer can easily dig through seaŋáš to access food.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Sievlla</h2>is very wet snow which occurs when the weather has been mild and the snow has begun to thaw completely through. The snow is wet and it is hard to walk on because a person or animal will sink completely through the snow to the ground.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Soavli</h2> is a mix of snow and water in which the snow melts from the bottom of the snow upwards. It is important to be careful when traveling in soavli, because the snow can be deep on the upper side of soavli, but soft and wet at the very base.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Bihci</h2> (ground surface frost) occurs when the ground is snow-free and cold. The cold conditions form bihci on the surface of the ground. The use of the concept Bihci is entirely associated with conditions on the ground
</p><br>

<p><h2>Ritni</h2> (frost on trees) is primarily formed on trees from warm moist air interacting with very cold snow surfaces. Specific weather conditions lead to the formation of ritni. Ritni sometimes occurs when there are is bare ground, but the snow must have been deposited before the warmer air arrives. If it has been cold for a long period of time, then “ritni” wood will occur and then it becomes difficult to see anything at all.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Njáhcu</h2>is wet snow which occurs as a result of alternating snows and thaws. This prevents reindeer from grazing. Should there be njáhcu in occurring in connection with All Saints Day, it will become a bad winter because subsequent rain and warmer, then colder temperatures will form geardni (ice) and produce bodneskárta conditions.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Geardni</h2>is a thin ice layer on the top surface of the snowpack. It occurs when it rains on the snowpack and then the rain freezes. The snow surface first becomes wet then frozen resulting in a thin ice layer on the top of the snow.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Gaskageardani</h2>is a condition in which one or more hard ice layers within the snow pack which occurs when it snows on top of a geardni ice layer. If the ice layer in the middle is not softened, but is still hard, it will limit the reindeers „ability to dig through the ice to access their forage. There may be several layers within the snowpack.
</p><br>

<p><h2>Bodneskárta</h2> is a condition that occurs in the fall when the early snow first melts across the ground and plants, then that water freezes, forming a hard coating of ice. The reindeer are not easily able to break through this layer to reach their food and this leads to a rudneguohtun winter.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Moarri</h2>is a condition in which a crust is formed on the surface of the snow as a result of alternative thawing and refreezing of the top layers. The crust is not quite hard enough to support the weight of people or reindeer and will cut the feet when one breaks through. The reindeer avoid going into moarri and will wait until it becomes cuoŋu. If you are trying to move the herd, it becomes very difficult to do so because it is hard for the reindeer to move through this type of snowpack. Moarri is almost hard enough to support the weight of the reindeer, but breaks once they step onto it.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Skáva</h2> is the formation of an ice layer or snow crust from sun melt at the surface of the snowpack during the day, followed quickly by cooling later in the evening. Skáva conditions are usually followed by cuoŋu conditions within the same day.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Cuoŋu</h2>snow conditions are different forms of melting snow which develop when the weather is very warm, sunny, and mild then followed by rain. The snow then becomes sievlla (and on the lakes it becomes soavli). But subsequently, when it becomes very cold and that snow freezes, it will be almost like ice. Then, it is good traveling conditions for the reindeer. But difficult traveling conditions for the herders. In the forest areas, cuoŋu develops first under these conditions..


</p><br>

<p><h2>Oppas</h2> Two types of oppas (untouched snow) are: 1) One type of oppas describes an area where there has not been re-feeding. The snow is soft and it is easy for the reindeer dig through the snow pack to reach the food at the bottom of the snowpack. These conditions enable the herd to move in pastures for feeding. 2) Another type of oppas is characterized by very deep snow which makes it difficult to travel because it is necessary to wade.

</p><br>

<p><h2>Seakŋut</h2> is a verb which describes the process by which Seaŋáš changes the snow so that it becomes more porous, and both bodneskárta and geardni disappear.

</p><br>
<p><h2>čiegar</h2>is hard snow which has been heavily trampled by reindeer and, thus, compressed into snow so hard that the reindeer are not able to dig through it to access the plants and the herders should avoid these areas. Sometimes the čiegar conditions can change to a more favorable snow state for grazing, and if it is an area rich in lichens, then the reindeer can be allowed to graze there. In the very rare cases where an area with small amounts of snow develops into čiegar conditions and the lichens are abundant, it is possible to let the reindeer graze this area before Christmas, but not throughout the winter. Reindeer cannot be returned repeatedly to these thinner snow areas to graze because the bottom of this snowpack will be frozen too hard to permit access to food.


</p><br>

<p><h2>Bearta</h2> is an intermediate condition which involves both bare ground and/or snowpack, which occurs in the fall after it has been snowing but when the weather has become milder again. The snow and ground become like ice - rough and hard. In some areas, it is bare ground; and in others, snow. It is difficult to see tracks and it is difficult to travel. The reindeer tend to walk a lot when it is bearta.

            <h1>the bigger picture</h1>
            <p>Situated south of the Arctic, the boreal forest region forms a continuous belt across the North America and Eurasia, amounting to 11% of Earth’s terrestrial surface and one of its largest biomes. Generally the arctic, subarctic and or mid-latitude
                regions with a cold climate are referred to as the boreal forest and are found in Russia, Canada, United States, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland (Burton et al. 2010). The circumboreal forest accounts for about one quarter of the world’s
                forested area, with a size of almost 1 billion hectares (Burton et al. 2003 as cited in Bergeron & Fenton 2012).<br><br> The establishment of the boreal forest region dates back to the mid-Pliocene when the decline of the Cenozoic temperature
                allowed the warmth-demanding trees of the Tertiary era to be replaced by the genera that is typically present nowadays in the boreal forest region (Crawford 2008).<br><br> Forests then largely disappeared from the high latitudes throughout
                the Pleistocene, placing all the forested area of the time much souther, however research on pollen records has shown that probably minor shrubs and herbs permitted the survival of pockets of tree in higher latitudes during the Last Glacial
                Maximum (Crawford 2008).<br><br> The succeeding Holocene enabled trees to resettle the north but never as far as Pliocene. However, during the early Pliocene, the tree migration was vast and rapid across both Europe and Canada allowing
                the boreal forest to advance far into the tundra biome. Now given that the cold weather has prevailed for the past 6000 years the boreal forest hadn’t had the opportunity since to forge ahead, until very recently as a side effect of the
                rise of temperature due to global warming. However that doesn’t mean the boreal forest had remained static all over those years. (Crawford 2008)<br><br> The boreal forest and the arctic tundra, are both major biomes which in total cover
                30 million square kilometres in the northern hemisphere; fundamentally different in flora, fauna and ecosystem productivity levels, have kept mostly apart, due to different thermal characteristics needs (Shugart et al. 1992), however as
                the climate warms the possibilities for the boreal of rest to advance into ‘the zone between the northern limit of the boreal forest (taiga) and the southern extent of the arctic tundra [..] (that) stretches for 13 400 kilometres around
                the northern hemisphere and across three continents’ (Crawford 2008) rises.

            <h1>the picture</h1>
            <p>First the icebergs retreated, gigantic masses of frozen water pulled up towards the north leaving behind bare mineral land.<br><br> Then the trees started spreading, quietly and peacefully, seed by seed, wind-blow by wind-blow, the seeds landed
                in over thousands of acres and 3 continents.<br><br> There was no overnight occupation, no grand skim of enslaving a land, just some wind, and some luck for a seed to land in land and not on a melting iceberg. There was also a mushroom,
                turning rock into nutrition, that without the seed wouldn’t have blossomed, that was pretty crucial.<br><br> And then came soil, mostly frozen for 10 months of the year, but the remaining two of 24 hours of sun were enough for the seed
                to turn into an infant, and for the infant to turn into infants. And so in the far north and circumpolar regions a forest grew out of pine seeds that carried mushrooms.<br><br> And as the forest are and blossomed, the pines worked the
                soil rich, and the forest bedding thick with smaller plants and bushes, now spruce also grew. And then fauna came, and started clearing the bedding floor, but once fauna was around it was figured that careful selection of small plants
                brings in the type of fauna you want. <br><br> You did so, first by small fires, but that made sense, it had happened before, occasionally, and it helped the forest grow. Then there were more fires, here and there and parts of the forest
                were transformed.<br><br> Deciduous now they were, shedding their leaves all winter, pilling them up on the forest floor. During the rainy summer no burning was possible, but during the dry summers the hills were covered in smoke.<br><br>                And so the pine decreased, and the burned spruce made room for birch, clear fields allowed for grazing and in glades now grey alder and juniper grew.<br><br> But the wind blew and those areas were surrounded by a birch forests and those
                forests by pines and those pines by spruces that were now climbing all the way up where the icebergs still stood.<br><br> By the time the fauna had grown custom to being around, and the forest bed was cleared. Fences were needed to round-up
                the reindeer twice a year.<br><br> And by the time the fences were made, the tree trunks were called wood, but just for seldom use. <br><br> But before the wind blew again, it was called timber.<br><br> Now that the pine was timber, the
                wind didn’t blew often enough, and the forest was to be grown for other purposes such as efficiency and extensiveness besides just chance and luck (Björn 2000).<br><br> The forest was now called underproductive and the swamps a waste,
                because timber didn’t grow there fast enough.<br><br> But there was space, and the felling tall pine was good, and making more of it just made sense, simplification and uniformity were things that the forest didn’t have enough, and was
                to be given (Björn 2000).<br><br> And “forest was divorced from nature, nature from its cycle, from the annual and daily rotation” (Björn 2000)<br><br> Soon, spruce was good enough and smaller trees and shorter trunks, mainly because there
                weren’t enough virgin forest, since the furthest and furthest and more remote untouched ones were now for a while begging called logging sites. There, where the pine had grown thick, and the wind still blew at its own pace, now were roads
                and squares and lamp posts.<br><br> And by 1970, all sites were good enough and the forests and the swamps and the mires, all the trunks were salvageable (Björn 2000).<br><br> And “forests belong to biology and ecology” (Björn 2000) and
                were to be regulated, because we were starting to run out them. So we categorised and named them, to keep track of them.<br><br> And so natural preserves were declared, and parks, and industrial forests and experimental forests and pseudo-traditional
                landscapes of virgin forest. And now the forest is again plenty and we can all have some, and tell our friends that ‘the forest cover in Finland is more extensive than in any other European country. Three fourths of the land area, some
                23 million hectares, is under forests’ (Björn 2000).<br><br> And this is how things look like now. And this is how forests are now.</p>

            <h1>the background</h1>
            <p>Somewhere south of the Reisa National Park, near the the border with Finland and the Norwegian county Troms is the source of the Alta River. Know as Alta River; Álttáeatnu; Alattionjoki, Alattionjoki, Guovdageaineatnu or Eatnu along its 250
                km run to Alta, to flow into the Altafjorden and by extend the Barents Sea. The river starts in the Kautokeino mountains and runs by the villages Kautokeino and Masi, from the high Finnmarks plateau to the Sautso Canyon, that begins just
                downstream from the Alta Power Station. <br><br> The Alta Power Station is perhaps one of the most controversial hydropower developments in Norway’s history, as it is even stated in the company’s website. When it construction was proposed
                in 1970 by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, it was just “the latest affront in a long history of Norway’s marginalisation of its indigenous peoples” (see Sámi State Conflicts)(Lawrence 2011)</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>For the Sámi, the construction of Alta Dam meant the displacement of their village, Masi, and serious impacts on their way of life. Their agricultural and fishing industries would be lost, as would traditional reindeer herding areas and the
                seasonal migration routes used by herders.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sami">
            <p>As a journalist covering the protests against the dam, Niillas Somby understood that those were the things this grandfather used to talk about, when he said : “you have to have respect for the river, for the land” (Somby 2014).<br><br> In
                his talk at the Documenta 14 panel 34 Exercises of Freedom : # 3 , Niillas Somby traces his life growing up as a Sámi and how the long discussions with his grandfather, taught him what is important to the traditional Sàmi life. He explains
                : “the main thing in being part in the traditional reindeer herding family is to have respect, very very very deep respect to the land, to the stones, to everything living and non-living thing in the nature”(Somby 2014)
                <br><br> Although the Sámi activists succeeded in scaling down the project, and saving Masi by 1976, the battle against the Norwegian Government and the construction of the dam continued till the autumn of 1982 and ended when the Norwegian
                Super Court decided that Sámi had no legal claim to their pastoral land (see Alta Controversy Timeline). That was 6 years of active mobilisation after their homes had been saved from induction. Why would a nation subject themselves to
                that ? To answer that one has to understand what ‘home’ is for the Sámi. </p>

            <p>When Somby speaks of home in the beginning of this talk, he speaks of lávvu, a conical temporary tent-like dwelling that until the late 1930s was the only type of housing the Sámi used. Currently the majority of Sámi and Somby himself most
                probably live in a permanent four wall house, yet lávvu have not disappeared, they are still used actively by reindeer herders and fishermen.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>As soon as the reindeer men had put up the lávvu, a place (báiki) would be formed, and a fire would be lit and coffee quickly brewed […] Yet while the lávvu, brought to life by its inhabitants, gather theirs activities into a focus of dwelling,
                the forest in which it stands is no less homely. Thus a Sámi person does not leave home to go to the forest.[…] For Sámi, home is open-ended and unbounded. (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008)</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sami">
            <p>As the lávvu is erected in the forest in the midst of working it centres its inhabitants, reindeer herding is an around the clock occupation that provides few scarce moments of rest, the lávvu is the type of precarious dwelling that allows
                anyone to rest when the chance is given. A herder doesn’t have to go home, like an office clerk goes home to rest. The notion of home is not directly connected with the nation of a precise permanent dwelling nor with the nation of ownership.
                There seems to be no need to separate “my land” from “not my land”, even now that Sámi inhabit permanent dwellings there are barely any fences.<br><br> Which might be explained by the fact that </p>

        <article class="quote">
            <p>from an indigenous perspective the landscape is not an intimate backdrop or substrate against of which animate being perform their respective tasks” (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008)</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sami">
            <p>Observations that you may find echoing in Niillas Somby statements : “People and animals are as much part of the landscape as are rocks and tress” (Somby 2014). For Sámi, who understand their land complexly, there was no difference between
                inducting their homes and destroying the pastoral lands or lakes; the forest is as much their home as is their dwellings. Their forests take their names from the activities that are conducted in them, from ‘herding forests’ to ‘fishing
                forests’ to even treeless forests like the open tundra downstream of Masi (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008). As their life and culture in inseparable from the forest, to effect the forest means to effect the Sámi. <br><br> Meaning that the power
                plant would effect them even if their “roofs over their heads” were not effected. Something that the Norwegian Government, the Norwegian Court System and the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate seemed not to understand, that
                the environmental consequences of the hydro plant would directly effect the Sámi culture (Paine 1982), perhaps because from the beginning that cultural or social considerations were not high on their priorities(Briggs 2000).<br><br> Sámi
                culture is centred around reindeer herding. Being the first animal to inhabit the land after the ice retreated, the Sámi have created a close relationship with the animal as it was their main source of clothing and food. Reindeer herding
                is all year around labor intensive operation that demands understanding of complex herd and natural behaviours. Having spend decades interacting and observing herds, the Sámi traditional knowledge of behavioural patterns extends so deeply
                that herders are able to predict herd movements. Patterns that span over time and space in the annual cycle of herd migration that require the herders to be in tune with their surrounding and to react to them quickly (Paine 1982).<br><br>                As Robert Paine observes in the report he was asked to write about the possible consequences of the Alta dam : </p>
        </article>
        <article class="quote">
            <p>Carefully laid plans are brought to nought by bad weather, by the intrusion of another herd — or by any one of a number of disturbances in the terrain that are increasingly common these days ( people, dogs, vehicles, machines)</p>
        </article>
        <article class="sami">
            <p>These patterns are exactly what the dam effected, the crucial reindeer migration routes, that are in themselves an intricate combination of pasture, weather, herds, space and time. Each terrain chosen carefully for different reasons ranging
                from adequate feeding and resting to giving birth and refraining from mixing with other herds while accommodating both the needs of the herd and the herders (Paine 1982).<br><br> So there laid a crucial difference between what the government
                saw as a space scarcely populated, as a location, in the north that was forecasted to need more electricity in the future and a solution, a hydro plant which was argued to be the most efficient and inexpensive way to do so. And what the
                landscape actually was for the people who inhabited it, an active participant in the Sámi life system. <br><br> Norwegian’s government narrow vision, exercised by conducting no prior research before the dam’s construction, made it possible
                to only focus on the desired aspects of it. Governments have a long tradition of abstracting and simplifying their inhabitants — human and non human— in the name of being eligible and by extent manageable (Scott 2008). Making the Sámi
                life, where humans and non-humans are complexly entangled in terms of space and time completely intangible.<br><br> In the few assessments about the implication of construction of the dam prior to its development, construction roads, electrical
                cables and transportation vehicles all crucial parts of the construction and operation of the dam where not included as aspects to be assessed for potential damage (Briggs 2006). Which reinforces the idea that the NVE and the Government
                addressed the project as it would be excluded and separate from the landscape and it was set to be built in. <br><br> To understand the impact of a detail like roads, in such a grand skim one has to think of roads not as just passive components
                but as an active participants to the system they are embedded in. Building roads creates accessibility. It disturbs the reindeer migration along side with other species that are crucial to sustaining the local environment and Sámi families,
                such as lichens & mosses, berries, fish and birds. It brings along the greater public and the network of state cabins.<br><br> What the government failed to understand is that Sámi culture is interwoven in reindeer herding, and reindeer
                herding is a system that involves humans, reindeer and land as active participants. And land encompasses at once the concepts of landscape, nature, space and terrain. When dealing with a culture in which casual descriptions to the landscape
                are so precise and elaborate that they can serve as maps (Gatski 2004). It is almost naive to try to treat its people with any less complexity.</p>
