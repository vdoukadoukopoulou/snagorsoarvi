      <p>Dear Reader, <br><br> Here are my concerns:<br><br> That if I ask you to forget, the first thing you will do is remember. The first thing will call up the second, the third and the fourth and a timeline will be established.<br><br> Linearities sneak up on you; they organise, order and arrange without you noticing ; allowing things to be easy to follow, making you expect simplicity. They frustrate me and I will try to avoid them.<br><br> I am looking for ways to express my thoughts like a walk, I am looking for ways to tell a story about time, where the I stands for the personal pronoun used by a speaker to refer to himself or herself but it is not limited to the 9th letter of the latin alphabet, the subject or the object of self-consciousness ; the ego, a line, the electric current or iodine. From perspectives that don’t assume humanity and avoid anthropomorphising. <br><br> Think of baroque polyphonic choirs, think of entanglements.<br><br> My voice being one of them, not the principal. As the author of this text, this is the only time I will exercise my authority over you, to offer you the following reminder. Partially because I am concerned with how much of a good job I have done and partially because I don’t know how accountable you will hold me. I would advise for very, and urge you to look closely through each line, for when I fail to do as I preach. <br><br> Now saying this, here is where we stand. You should forget and proceed to read with no assumptions and prior knowledge of how things are ought to be or you should keep on remembering that you know and you assume.<br><br> Welcoming remarks,<br> Victoria
