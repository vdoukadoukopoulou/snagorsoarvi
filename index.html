      <p>Dear Reader, <br><br> Here are my <span class="footnote">12</span> concerns:<br><br> That if I ask you to forget, the first thing you will do is remember. The first thing will call up the second, the third and the fourth and a timeline will be established.<br><br> Linearities sneak up on you; they organise, order and arrange without you noticing ; allowing things to be easy to follow, making you expect simplicity. They frustrate me and I will try to avoid them.<br><br> I am looking for ways to express my thoughts like a walk, I am looking for ways to tell a story about time, where the I stands for the personal pronoun used by a speaker to refer to himself or herself but it is not limited to the 9th letter of the latin alphabet, the subject or the object of self-consciousness ; the ego, a line, the electric current or iodine. From perspectives that don’t assume humanity and avoid anthropomorphising. <br><br> Think of baroque polyphonic choirs, think of entanglements.<br><br> My voice being one of them, not the principal. As the author of this text, this is the only time I will exercise my authority over you, to offer you the following reminder. Partially because I am concerned with how much of a good job I have done and partially because I don’t know how accountable you will hold me. I would advise for very, and urge you to look closely through each line, for when I fail to do as I preach. <br><br> Now saying this, here is where we stand. You should forget and proceed to read with no assumptions and prior knowledge of how things are ought to be or you should keep on remembering that you know and you assume.<br><br> Welcoming remarks,<br> Victoria

        <p>Since its establishment as a scientific concept by Newton, time has gained its objectiveness through being uniform, infinite, continuous and effortlessly divisible (Sorokin & Merton 1937). Time gains some of its other characteristics from Christianity, its foundation in the now is predominately influenced by the Christian vision of the world where earthly time and eternity, are separated, since ‘eternity cannot be measured in segments of time, it is an attribute of God’ (Gardet 1976) disconnecting time from past and future. <br><br> The mechanised clock itself was built in order to gain preciseness in praying.

        <p>In 1339 Heinrich Suso wrote a manuscript about a clock (“Horologium Sapentiae / Wisdom’s Watch upon the Hour”) that serves as a means of communication between man and the divine order. The clock translates the divine order into language that the ordinary man can understand. Particularly when it is time to pray</p>

        <p>Since, we have moved from that imprecise mechanical clock forward to the extremely precise, atomic clock, recently building one that will probably outlast our Sun. This quest for the precise, has moved as from clock with approximate errors of 15 min per day to 1 second per 10 billion years (Stromberg & Plumer 2016).<br><br> Time seems to exist independently of us, it is universal; an hour is an hour, is sixty minutes, three thousand six hundred seconds indifferently to whether it was spend productively or dreadfully (Ingold 1993). You would imagine that as our time is astrological and literally reflects the rotation of the Earth that it would be grounded in our understanding in such way but, it isn’t, time seems to exists anywhere else but here. <br><br> The contemporary man is more than capable of dealing with time recklessly at ease. We seem to have mastered time, created it, figured out how to measure it , divided it with great precision, and trace it back million of years to its creation and yet somehow we seem to lack the understanding of its temporality or how is can be perceived differently.</p>

        <h1>side thought</h1>
        <p>June 30th 2012 was the third ‘leap second’ incident after almost a decade of not having any. As the Earth’s rotation around itself actually takes 24 hours and 2 seconds instead of just 24, every now and then the International Telecommunications Union (UTI) has to add a second to even things out (Stromberg & Plumer 2016).<br><br> This is necessary due to the existence of two times : Greenwich Mean Time, which alines noon with the time when the sun is at it’s highest position in Greenwich, London and was the time all official clocks followed until the of fall 1967 when most countries switched over to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is calculated as 1 second of mean solar time at 0° longitude (Stromberg & Plumer 2016). <br><br> Due to the fact that the later clock takes into account the Earth’s rotation there is a difference created between the two clocks, less than a second in a year, up to 30 seconds since the implementation of UTC turns into minutes and hours as the year and millennia go by (Stromberg & Plumer 2016).<br><br> It was that leap second 23:59:60 that caused Reddit to be in different states of off for about 2 hours. Reddit, the popular social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website runs on the operating system Linux. Originally the glitch that was driving the servers into hyperactivity was attributed to something else, but after a while the true cause was found. In one of the most basic levels of the operating system, a linux kernel, the hrtimer couldn’t understand what the extra second was (McMillan 2012).</p>

        <article class="quote">
          <p>hrtimer is a subsystem that used when an application is “sleeping,” waiting for the OS to complete some other task. In some cases, it sets a kind of alarm clock for these sleeping applications that will go off when the OS is taking too much time with its other work.”</p>
        </article>

        <p>What seems to have happened is that when the leap second arrived the hrtimer became a second ahead of the OS, and started awaking several of those sleeping applications and running the system into hyperactivity. The solution came by eventually restarting the servers (McMillan 2012).
          <br><br> The problem with leap seconds is that programmers built the core kernels which have to deal with them in the 1970s when leap seconds weren’t a thing yet. They were built with the expectation that time always move forward, time cannot go backwards and time cannot repeat itself. All principles that the leap seconds renounces(McMillan 2012).
          <br><br> Mozzilla, The Gawker, Stumble Upon, Yelp, Foursquare and Linkedln, all also carried confused hrtimer kernels that caused similar problems (Webster 2012). Google hoping to avoid major problems has created an antidote called the “leap smear”. It operates by modifying Google’s NTP servers, the Network Time Protocol which </p>
        <article class="quote">
          <p>periodically checks the computers’ time against a more accurate server, which may be connected to an external source of time, such as an atomic clock</p>
        </article>
        <p>and adds occasionally a couple milliseconds making so that when the leap second finally arrives Google’s clock will have already accounted for it (Pascoe 2011). It is a 20 hour linear smear, 72,000 SI seconds that eventually add up to the required leap (Google Public NTP 2017).
          <br><br> In a sense the leap smear slows down the hrtimer to meet with with the Earth’s rotation. Making Google’s servers, clocks and computers for 20 hours at a time completely in tune with the landscape they exist upon more than the humans who programmed them. </p>
      </article>
      <article class="time">

        <p>If it wasn’t for software we would have very little or any at all interaction with leap seconds, or by extend the rotation of the Earth for that matter. Our electronic devises and clock update automatically and if they don’t, running a second ahead wouldn’t be able noticeable by anyone. This is mostly due to the fact that humans inhabit social time instead of astrological time (Sorokin & Merton 1937).</p>

        <p>Social time is manifested in expressions like ‘let’s meet during lunch’ or ‘i haven’t seen him since highschool’ or ‘right after the Obama administration’ all indicating points of time in respect to social events rather than astrological time. Lone astrological time references like 30/06/2012 or 1982 or March 2nd become significant only when they are put within social references (Sorokin & Merton 1937).

        <p>Big general concepts that effect everyone, become staples of social time in urban settings such as work hours, weekends or holidays. Smaller events like natural phenomena, birthdays or which fruits are in season fail to reach the common social time system.<br><br> Social time is not ‘uniform and homogenous’ like astrological time. It is heterogenous, allowing several different systems and kinds of time to exist parallel and interwoven to each other. Greek immigrants talking to each other on the train can remark upon not seeing their families since Clean Monday (27/2/2017) while looking forward to seeing them again in Koningsdag,(27/04/2017) and understand each other as they a part of two social time understandings.<br><br> 23:59:60 as a SI second falls under astronomical time but as ‘leap second’ as an event it enters the social time sphere, creating a moment of common reference in our western social time not centred around human, that is as rare as a leap second.<br><br> Our perception of time — social and astrological — solemnly follows the rhythms of human social life. 9 at work is 9 at work, irrelevant to whether it is dark or light or papayas are in season. </p>

        <p> progress is a forward march , drawing other kinds of time into its rhythms. Without that driving beat we might notice other temporal patterns […] agnostic about where we are going, we might look for what has been ignored because it never fit the timeline of progress.</p>

      <article class="time">
        <p>Perhaps it is the driving beat of progress or the authority of the clock that doesn’t allow us to experience temporal patterns within our rigid timelines.<br><br> Yet within the heterogeneity of social time immigrants and indigenous people have succeeded in avoiding that singular uniform homogenous beat.<br><br> Sámi have inhabited those temporal patters for years. Partially due to marginalisation and discrimination and partially due to their occupation, reindeer heading that does not allow to tune out from other kinds of time and only focus on the driving beat of human progress.

      <article class="quote">
        <p>Progress is embedded too, in widely accepted assumptions about what it means to be human. […] we learn over and over again that human are different from the rest of the living world because we look forward - while other species, which live day by day, are thus dependent on us</p>

        <p>Their social time follows mutually the cycles of human and non-human environments. Weekends are not social time staples because during the rounding season or the earmarking, rest days , if any, are uncertain.
          <br><br> Preciseness or punctuality is trade in for variability, proximity and temporality. Mazzullo and Inglod observe that to represent a few moments, Sámi would use an expression meaning ‘the lighting of a pipe’ (pii’po-tsâhk ’ke ’tâm-pod’dâ) and a longer period would be ‘the time needed to brew coffee’ (käf ’ fevuos’ sâm-pod’dâ) and depending to where those expressions were used, it would range from a few minutes (village) to a period of few hours (forest) (2008).
          <br><br> Time is interwoven into activities, it is culturally understood that tasks or travelling might take longer than anticipated. When one travels through the boreal forest, he can provide only vague indications on how much time it will take to arrive and to return, the vastness of the forest region is such that a traveller cannot anticipate if something will occur or when (Mazzullo & Inglod 2008).
          <br><br> Duration, is another notion, that is treated differently within the Sámi understanding of time preciseness is so embedded in the western thought of time, that tasks and activities tend to demand a finite start and end, unlike the reindeer herding, which as a nature of work cannot be dictated by a clock marking the start and the end.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>when Sámi people go to the forest from reindeer separation or earmarking of calves, no-one would ever look at their watches. [..] In winter, the reindeer separation would be started in pitch darkness and it would still be dark when the work was finished’</p>
      </article>
      <article class="time">
        <p>It would be easy here to argue that the Sámi understanding of time is circular and it evokes a sense of local infinity that western understanding doesn’t, to create images of Sámi living without clocks and beyond time, fundamentally opposing the west. To follow and argument like that would play right into the hands and dualistic discourse in which time has always been discussed in.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>the logic of that argument being that there exists a clear-cut and structured division between western and non-western understanding of the world, running from the very categorical distinction between modern and traditional societies, to the more subtle difference between a supposedly western understanding of time as linear, cumulative and irreversible and the non-western notion of time as cyclical, non-cumulative and reversible</p>
      </article>
      <article class="time">
        <p>yet the world doesn’t work like this, even though the West likes to write about it in that way.<br><br> The Sámi have spend years in contact or as part of the west world. Suffered from marginalisation and forced assimilation, years of timely issued taxes and fines to be payed in order to be allowed to live in their land. Legislation that did not allow them to speak their language or practise their religion. Nowadays Sámi have jobs outside reindeer herding, they serve as teachers or doctors or lawyers. They have jobs that require them to follow at 9 to 5 schedule.<br><br> The Sámi perception of time is very much aware of western time systems, and it not be romanticised as a “truer” or “simpler”. It functions within the heterogeneous social time.
          <br><br> Sámi time understanding, much like Sámi culture, is founded in the landscape they inhabit. Time does not appear as a mystical powerful force that determines everything (Gardet 1976). As seen in Valkeapää words ‘time does not exist ’, not because time is elsewhere or time is elusive , but because time is ‘located’. The centre lyric of the poem with single word land , carries much of weight of time and location: time is experienced like the landscape, it is as familiar as the forest, the present as a form of duration blends in with the past and the future and it is representation in the flora and the fauna of the boreal forest, the past never ceases to exist as it is found in the repetition of activities conducted in the forest and the forest itself. Time is located ‘here’.<br><br> When time is located here, it is ‘living day by day’ and entangled with concepts of indeterminacy and precarity. Because on is open to the possibilities of encounters, that force one to learn to be capable of adapting and transforming. Actions or procedures have an undetermined end and start, yet be repetitive </p>

          <br><br> Sámi traditional knowledge in terms of snow and reindeer herding reflects practicing such living :</p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>So when somebody says that there is cuoŋu (“strong- crusted snow”) now, then the other person immediately knows that the snow is now so hard that it provides an excellent surface to move and travel on, but at the same time he or she also knows that in such conditions the reindeer move quickly over great distances, which, in turn means that the herd must be tightly managed to avoid it running off or breaking up and scattering. These terms contain references to the interaction between reindeer, man and land.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="time">
        <p>The myriad of Sámi terms (see Sámi Traditional Snow Terminology) like cuoŋu , used to describe precise snow characteristic are crucial in respect to grazing, mobility and tracking. Identifying quickly such factors is important because the snow conditions directly affect the survival and well being of the reindeer (Eira 2013). The traditional Sámi snow terms identify snow characteristics in regard of food access, mobility, tracking, visibility, season and snow layers (Eira 2013).</p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>the wind is an important modifier of snow crystals and the snowpack. It leads to development of čearga snow conditions. When strong cold winds transport the snow, snow particles are broken down in turbulent drift. These broken particles often form a strong and dense snowpack. Čearga can be so hard that neither reindeer nor people can dig through the snow. In areas with čearga, reindeer are “locked out” from grazing on the plants beneath the snow. This causes poor feeding conditions for the reindeer. The thickness of a čearga layer can be from 5 cm to one meter deep. Čearga conditions affect the mobility of both reindeer and humans as it is easy to travel on this type of snow. Consequently the herders have to be very careful not to lose individual reindeer to neighboring herds. However, in terms of tracking capabilities, čearga is unfavorable. It is difficult to see where individual reindeer have been walking. Čearga is at the top of the snowpack, but may include as much as half the snowpack when grazing conditions are poor. The term čearga is used in winter, from January to April.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="time">
        <p>In the Sámi life, preciseness is attributed in terms of spatial characteristics (weather, snow, conditions, herd location etc) and not in terms of time ( 09/07/2017 or 6 o’clock) (Mazzullo 2012). Making it so that if there is čearga perhaps a trip will be postponed until it passes or a herder will choose to keep moving in search of another terrain instead of resting.</p>

        <h1>the bigger picture</h1>
        <p>Situated south of the Arctic, the boreal forest region forms a continuous belt across the North America and Eurasia, amounting to 11% of Earth’s terrestrial surface and one of its largest biomes. Generally the arctic, subarctic and or mid-latitude regions with a cold climate are referred to as the boreal forest and are found in Russia, Canada, United States, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland (Burton et al. 2010). The circumboreal forest accounts for about one quarter of the world’s forested area, with a size of almost 1 billion hectares (Burton et al. 2003 as cited in Bergeron & Fenton 2012).<br><br> The establishment of the boreal forest region dates back to the mid-Pliocene when the decline of the Cenozoic temperature allowed the warmth-demanding trees of the Tertiary era to be replaced by the genera that is typically present nowadays in the boreal forest region (Crawford 2008).<br><br> Forests then largely disappeared from the high latitudes throughout the Pleistocene, placing all the forested area of the time much souther, however research on pollen records has shown that probably minor shrubs and herbs permitted the survival of pockets of tree in higher latitudes during the Last Glacial Maximum (Crawford 2008).<br><br> The succeeding Holocene enabled trees to resettle the north but never as far as Pliocene. However, during the early Pliocene, the tree migration was vast and rapid across both Europe and Canada allowing the boreal forest to advance far into the tundra biome. Now given that the cold weather has prevailed for the past 6000 years the boreal forest hadn’t had the opportunity since to forge ahead, until very recently as a side effect of the rise of temperature due to global warming. However that doesn’t mean the boreal forest had remained static all over those years. (Crawford 2008)<br><br> The boreal forest and the arctic tundra, are both major biomes which in total cover 30 million square kilometres in the northern hemisphere; fundamentally different in flora, fauna and ecosystem productivity levels, have kept mostly apart, due to different thermal characteristics needs (Shugart et al. 1992), however as the climate warms the possibilities for the boreal of rest to advance into ‘the zone between the northern limit of the boreal forest (taiga) and the southern extent of the arctic tundra [..] (that) stretches for 13 400 kilometres around the northern hemisphere and across three continents’ (Crawford 2008) rises.

        <p>First the icebergs retreated, gigantic masses of frozen water pulled up towards the north leaving behind bare mineral land.<br><br> Then the trees started spreading, quietly and peacefully, seed by seed, wind-blow by wind-blow, the seeds landed in over thousands of acres and 3 continents.<br><br> There was no overnight occupation, no grand skim of enslaving a land, just some wind, and some luck for a seed to land in land and not on a melting iceberg. There was also a mushroom, turning rock into nutrition, that without the seed wouldn’t have blossomed, that was pretty crucial.<br><br> And then came soil, mostly frozen for 10 months of the year, but the remaining two of 24 hours of sun were enough for the seed to turn into an infant, and for the infant to turn into infants. And so in the far north and circumpolar regions a forest grew out of pine seeds that carried mushrooms.<br><br> And as the forest are and blossomed, the pines worked the soil rich, and the forest bedding thick with smaller plants and bushes, now spruce also grew. And then fauna came, and started clearing the bedding floor, but once fauna was around it was figured that careful selection of small plants brings in the type of fauna you want. <br><br> You did so, first by small fires, but that made sense, it had happened before, occasionally, and it helped the forest grow. Then there were more fires, here and there and parts of the forest were transformed.<br><br> Deciduous now they were, shedding their leaves all winter, pilling them up on the forest floor. During the rainy summer no burning was possible, but during the dry summers the hills were covered in smoke.<br><br> And so the pine decreased, and the burned spruce made room for birch, clear fields allowed for grazing and in glades now grey alder and juniper grew.<br><br> But the wind blew and those areas were surrounded by a birch forests and those forests by pines and those pines by spruces that were now climbing all the way up where the icebergs still stood.<br><br> By the time the fauna had grown custom to being around, and the forest bed was cleared. Fences were needed to round-up the reindeer twice a year.<br><br> And by the time the fences were made, the tree trunks were called wood, but just for seldom use. <br><br> But before the wind blew again, it was called timber.<br><br> Now that the pine was timber, the wind didn’t blew often enough, and the forest was to be grown for other purposes such as efficiency and extensiveness besides just chance and luck (Björn 2000).<br><br> The forest was now called underproductive and the swamps a waste, because timber didn’t grow there fast enough.<br><br> But there was space, and the felling tall pine was good, and making more of it just made sense, simplification and uniformity were things that the forest didn’t have enough, and was to be given (Björn 2000).<br><br> And “forest was divorced from nature, nature from its cycle, from the annual and daily rotation” (Björn 2000)<br><br> Soon, spruce was good enough and smaller trees and shorter trunks, mainly because there weren’t enough virgin forest, since the furthest and furthest and more remote untouched ones were now for a while begging called logging sites. There, where the pine had grown thick, and the wind still blew at its own pace, now were roads and squares and lamp posts.<br><br> And by 1970, all sites were good enough and the forests and the swamps and the mires, all the trunks were salvageable (Björn 2000).<br><br> And “forests belong to biology and ecology” (Björn 2000) and were to be regulated, because we were starting to run out them. So we categorised and named them, to keep track of them.<br><br> And so natural preserves were declared, and parks, and industrial forests and experimental forests and pseudo-traditional landscapes of virgin forest. And now the forest is again plenty and we can all have some, and tell our friends that ‘the forest cover in Finland is more extensive than in any other European country. Three fourths of the land area, some 23 million hectares, is under forests’ (Björn 2000).<br><br> And this is how things look like now. And this is how forests are now.</p>

The river starts in the Kautokeino mountains and runs by the villages Kautokeino and Masi, from the high Finnmarks plateau to the Sautso Canyon, that begins just downstream from the Alta Power Station. <br><br> The Alta Power Station is perhaps one of the most controversial hydropower developments in Norway’s history, as it is even stated in the company’s website. When it construction was proposed in 1970 by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, it was just “the latest affront in a long history of Norway’s marginalisation of its indigenous peoples” (see Sámi State Conflicts)(Lawrence 2011)</p>

        <p>For the Sámi, the construction of Alta Dam meant the displacement of their village, Masi, and serious impacts on their way of life. Their agricultural and fishing industries would be lost, as would traditional reindeer herding areas and the seasonal migration routes used by herders.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="sami">
        <p>As a journalist covering the protests against the dam, Niillas Somby understood that those were the things this grandfather used to talk about, when he said : “you have to have respect for the river, for the land” (Somby 2014).<br><br> In his talk at the Documenta 14 panel 34 Exercises of Freedom : # 3 , Niillas Somby traces his life growing up as a Sámi and how the long discussions with his grandfather, taught him what is important to the traditional Sàmi life. He explains : “the main thing in being part in the traditional reindeer herding family is to have respect, very very very deep respect to the land, to the stones, to everything living and non-living thing in the nature”(Somby 2014)
          <br><br> Although the Sámi activists succeeded in scaling down the project, and saving Masi by 1976, the battle against the Norwegian Government and the construction of the dam continued till the autumn of 1982 and ended when the Norwegian Super Court decided that Sámi had no legal claim to their pastoral land (see Alta Controversy Timeline). That was 6 years of active mobilisation after their homes had been saved from induction. Why would a nation subject themselves to that ? To answer that one has to understand what ‘home’ is for the Sámi. </p>

        <p>When Somby speaks of home in the beginning of this talk, he speaks of lávvu, a conical temporary tent-like dwelling that until the late 1930s was the only type of housing the Sámi used. Currently the majority of Sámi and Somby himself most probably live in a permanent four wall house, yet lávvu have not disappeared, they are still used actively by reindeer herders and fishermen.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>As soon as the reindeer men had put up the lávvu, a place (báiki) would be formed, and a fire would be lit and coffee quickly brewed […] Yet while the lávvu, brought to life by its inhabitants, gather theirs activities into a focus of dwelling, the forest in which it stands is no less homely. Thus a Sámi person does not leave home to go to the forest.[…] For Sámi, home is open-ended and unbounded. (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008)</p>
      </article>
      <article class="sami">
        <p>As the lávvu is erected in the forest in the midst of working it centres its inhabitants, reindeer herding is an around the clock occupation that provides few scarce moments of rest, the lávvu is the type of precarious dwelling that allows anyone to rest when the chance is given. A herder doesn’t have to go home, like an office clerk goes home to rest. The notion of home is not directly connected with the nation of a precise permanent dwelling nor with the nation of ownership. There seems to be no need to separate “my land” from “not my land”, even now that Sámi inhabit permanent dwellings there are barely any fences.<br><br> Which might be explained by the fact that </p>

        <p>from an indigenous perspective the landscape is not an intimate backdrop or substrate against of which animate being perform their respective tasks” (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008)</p>
      </article>
      <article class="sami">
        <p>Observations that you may find echoing in Niillas Somby statements : “People and animals are as much part of the landscape as are rocks and tress” (Somby 2014). For Sámi, who understand their land complexly, there was no difference between inducting their homes and destroying the pastoral lands or lakes; the forest is as much their home as is their dwellings. Their forests take their names from the activities that are conducted in them, from ‘herding forests’ to ‘fishing forests’ to even treeless forests like the open tundra downstream of Masi (Mazzullo & Ingold 2008). As their life and culture in inseparable from the forest, to effect the forest means to effect the Sámi. <br><br> Meaning that the power plant would effect them even if their “roofs over their heads” were not effected. Something that the Norwegian Government, the Norwegian Court System and the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate seemed not to understand, that the environmental consequences of the hydro plant would directly effect the Sámi culture (Paine 1982), perhaps because from the beginning that cultural or social considerations were not high on their priorities(Briggs 2000).<br><br> Sámi culture is centred around reindeer herding. Being the first animal to inhabit the land after the ice retreated, the Sámi have created a close relationship with the animal as it was their main source of clothing and food. Reindeer herding is all year around labor intensive operation that demands understanding of complex herd and natural behaviours. Having spend decades interacting and observing herds, the Sámi traditional knowledge of behavioural patterns extends so deeply that herders are able to predict herd movements. Patterns that span over time and space in the annual cycle of herd migration that require the herders to be in tune with their surrounding and to react to them quickly (Paine 1982).<br><br> As Robert Paine observes in the report he was asked to write about the possible consequences of the Alta dam : </p>
      </article>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>Carefully laid plans are brought to nought by bad weather, by the intrusion of another herd — or by any one of a number of disturbances in the terrain that are increasingly common these days ( people, dogs, vehicles, machines)</p>
      </article>
      <article class="sami">
        <p>These patterns are exactly what the dam effected, the crucial reindeer migration routes, that are in themselves an intricate combination of pasture, weather, herds, space and time. Each terrain chosen carefully for different reasons ranging from adequate feeding and resting to giving birth and refraining from mixing with other herds while accommodating both the needs of the herd and the herders (Paine 1982).<br><br> So there laid a crucial difference between what the government saw as a space scarcely populated, as a location, in the north that was forecasted to need more electricity in the future and a solution, a hydro plant which was argued to be the most efficient and inexpensive way to do so. And what the landscape actually was for the people who inhabited it, an active participant in the Sámi life system. <br><br> Norwegian’s government narrow vision, exercised by conducting no prior research before the dam’s construction, made it possible to only focus on the desired aspects of it. Governments have a long tradition of abstracting and simplifying their inhabitants — human and non human— in the name of being eligible and by extent manageable (Scott 2008). Making the Sámi life, where humans and non-humans are complexly entangled in terms of space and time completely intangible.<br><br> In the few assessments about the implication of construction of the dam prior to its development, construction roads, electrical cables and transportation vehicles all crucial parts of the construction and operation of the dam where not included as aspects to be assessed for potential damage (Briggs 2006). Which reinforces the idea that the NVE and the Government addressed the project as it would be excluded and separate from the landscape and it was set to be built in. <br><br> To understand the impact of a detail like roads, in such a grand skim one has to think of roads not as just passive components but as an active participants to the system they are embedded in. Building roads creates accessibility. It disturbs the reindeer migration along side with other species that are crucial to sustaining the local environment and Sámi families, such as lichens & mosses, berries, fish and birds. It brings along the greater public and the network of state cabins.<br><br> What the government failed to understand is that Sámi culture is interwoven in reindeer herding, and reindeer herding is a system that involves humans, reindeer and land as active participants. And land encompasses at once the concepts of landscape, nature, space and terrain. When dealing with a culture in which casual descriptions to the landscape are so precise and elaborate that they can serve as maps (Gatski 2004). It is almost naive to try to treat its people with any less complexity.</p>

        <p>For the native dweller, the landscape tells — or rather is — a story. It enfolds the lives and times of predecessors who, over the generations, have moved around in it and played their part in its formation. To perceive the landscape is therefore to carry out an act of remembrance, and remembering is not so much a matter of calling up an internal image, stored in the mind, as of engaging perceptually with an environment that is itself pregnant with the past (Ingold 2010).</p>
